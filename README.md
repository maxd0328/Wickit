Wickit is a self-contained programming language based around the idea of contracts (traits) and algebra of sets on those contracts.

This project is a compiler and runtime engine for the Wickit language, written primarily in C++. The engine also acts as a module-based build system, capable of dynamically rebuilding projects as necessary before or during runtime.

See below for language documentation.
